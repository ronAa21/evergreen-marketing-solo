# Loan Accounting Module - Setup & Usage Guide

## Overview
The Loan Accounting Module provides comprehensive loan management features including loan tracking, payment schedules, filtering, reporting, and audit trails.

### Creating Manual Loans
Use phpMyAdmin or MySQL to insert new loans:

```sql
INSERT INTO loans (
    loan_no, 
    loan_type_id, 
    borrower_external_no, 
    principal_amount, 
    interest_rate, 
    start_date, 
    term_months, 
    monthly_payment, 
    current_balance, 
    status, 
    created_by
) VALUES (
    'LOAN-2024-009',
    1,  -- Personal Loan type
    'EMP001',
    200000.00,
    12.5000,
    '2024-10-27',
    36,
    6700.00,
    200000.00,
    'active',
    1  -- User ID
);
```

### Recording Payments

```sql
INSERT INTO loan_payments (
    loan_id,
    payment_date,
    amount,
    principal_amount,
    interest_amount,
    payment_reference
) VALUES (
    1,  -- Loan ID
    '2024-10-27',
    6700.00,
    4616.67,
    2083.33,
    'PAY-2024-500'
);

-- Update loan balance
UPDATE loans 
SET current_balance = current_balance - 4616.67 
WHERE id = 1;
```

## Status Definitions

- **Pending**: Loan application pending approval
- **Active**: Loan is active and payments are being made
- **Paid**: Loan has been fully paid
- **Defaulted**: Loan is in default (missed payments)
- **Cancelled**: Loan was cancelled/deleted (soft delete)

## Best Practices

1. **Always use loan types**: Define loan types before creating loans
2. **Record all payments**: Keep payment history up to date
3. **Regular reconciliation**: Match loan balances with payment records
4. **Use audit trail**: Review changes and maintain compliance
5. **Backup regularly**: Keep database backups before bulk operations

## Integration Points

The Loan Accounting module integrates with:
- **Journal Entries**: Loan disbursements and payments can be linked to journal entries
- **Employee References**: Borrowers linked to employee records
- **Audit Logs**: All operations logged for compliance
- **Bin Station**: Deleted loans available for restoration

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Loan Data Available"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure database schema is created
- Run `sample_loan_data.sql` for test data
- Check database connection in `config/database.php`

### Issue: Maturity date not showing correctly
**Solution**: Maturity date is calculated as `start_date + term_months`. Ensure both fields are populated.

### Issue: Cannot delete loan
**Solution**: 
- Only non-paid loans should be deleted
- Check user permissions
- Verify loan exists and is not already cancelled

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for the module:
- Loan application workflow
- Automated payment processing
- Interest calculation automation
- Payment reminders and notifications
- Amortization schedule generation
- Loan restructuring features
- Integration with payroll for salary deduction
- Mobile responsive improvements
- Bulk loan import/export
