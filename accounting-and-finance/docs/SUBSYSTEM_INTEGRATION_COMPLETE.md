# 🎯 SUBSYSTEM INTEGRATION - COMPLETE

## Overview
Your Accounting & Finance system is now **fully integrated** with all subsystems:
- ✅ Bank System (bank-system/)
- ✅ HRIS System (hris-sia/)
- ✅ Loan Subsystem (LoanSubsystem/)

All transactions from these systems are now **automatically** synced to your accounting modules.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED INTEGRATIONS

### 1. Transaction Reading Module
**File:** `modules/transaction-reading.php`

**What's New:**
- Now displays **ALL transactions** from both:
  - Journal Entries (Accounting System)
  - Bank Transactions (Bank System)
- Uses UNION query to combine data sources
- Each transaction tagged with source (`'journal'` or `'bank'`)
- Filters work across both sources

**Transaction Sources:**
| Source | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Journal | Manual accounting entries | Adjustments, Corrections |
| Bank | Customer transactions | Deposits, Withdrawals, Transfers, Loan Payments, Loan Disbursements |

---

### 2. Automatic Journal Entry Creation
**Files:**
- `database/sql/integration_triggers.sql`
- `database/sql/install_triggers.php`
- `database/sql/fix_loan_payment_trigger.php`

**Installed Triggers:**

#### 🏦 **Bank Transaction Trigger** (`after_bank_transaction_insert`)
- **Fires:** When a new bank transaction occurs
- **Creates:** Cash Receipt (CR) or Cash Disbursement (CD) journal entry
- **Logic:**
  - **Deposits (amount > 0):** Debit Cash, Credit Accounts Receivable
  - **Withdrawals (amount < 0):** Debit Accounts Receivable, Credit Cash

#### 💰 **Loan Disbursement Trigger** (`after_loan_disbursement`)
- **Fires:** When loan status changes to 'disbursed'
- **Creates:** General Journal (GJ) entry
- **Logic:**
  - Debit: Loan Receivable
  - Credit: Cash

#### 💳 **Loan Payment Trigger** (`after_loan_payment`)
- **Fires:** When a loan payment is recorded
- **Creates:** Cash Receipt (CR) journal entry
- **Logic:**
  - Debit: Cash (full payment)
  - Credit: Loan Receivable (principal portion)
  - Credit: Interest Income (interest portion)

#### 👥 **Payroll Run Trigger** (`after_payroll_run_insert`)
- **Fires:** When a new payroll run is created
- **Creates:** Payroll (PR) journal entry
- **Logic:**
  - Debit: Salaries Expense (gross pay)
  - Credit: Cash/Bank (net pay)
  - Credit: Salaries Payable (deductions)
