## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone/Download the Project
```bash
# Place the project in your XAMPP htdocs directory
C:\xampp\htdocs\accounting-and-finance\
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Start XAMPP and ensure MySQL is running
2. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
3. Import the unified database schema:
   - Go to the **Import** tab
   - Choose the file `database/unified_schema.sql`
   - Click **Go** to execute
4. **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Insert the admin user and sample data:
   - Go to the **SQL** tab and select the `BankingDB` database
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database/Sampled_data.sql`
   - Click **Go** to execute
   - **Without this step, you cannot log in to the system!**

**Alternative:** Use the automated setup script:
- Navigate to: `http://localhost/accounting-and-finance/database/init.php`
- This will create database, schema, and admin user automatically

### 3. Configuration
The database configuration is already set up in `config/database.php` for XAMPP default settings:
- Host: localhost
- Database: BankingDB
- Username: root
- Password: (empty)

### 4. Access the System
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost/accounting-and-finance/core/login.php
```
Or simply:
```
http://localhost/accounting-and-finance/
```
(The root index.php will redirect you to the login page)
